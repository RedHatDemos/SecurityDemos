= Lab 2: Security Enhanced Linux

== Goal of Lab
The goal of this lab is to use Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) to help mitigate attacks due to privilege escalation vulnerabilities in a three part exercise.

* In the first part of this lab exercise, you will become a hacker and try to execute a real vulnerability on a given Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system and explore how SELinux can help to protect this system.
* In the second part of this lab exercise, you will turn SELinux on for an environment of web servers in an automated fashion using Ansible.
* In the last part of this lab exercise, you will configure SELinux according to a U.S. Department of Defense STIG security control policy rule.

== Introduction
Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) can help to proactively mitigate systems from the consequences of exploits during the window of vulnerability. Specifically, this is the time window before a security fix is released. This protection is done by defining SELinux policies on your systems.

=== SELinux policy
SELinux *isolates* all processes running on the system to *mitigate* attacks which take advantage of privilege escalation vulnerabilities. A privilege escalation vulnerability means that a process gains more access rights than it should have. To prevent this, SELinux enforces Mandatory Access Control (MAC) mechanism over all processes. It labels every process, file, or directory according to rules specified in a security policy known as the SELinux policy. The SELinux policy also specifies how processes interact with each other and how they can access files and directories. SELinux denies every action that it is not explicitly allowed by the SELinux policy.

In one of the below exercises, we'll see an example where using this process isolation can help protect us from a privilege escalation vulnerability of an exploit.

=== Introduction to the Shellshock vulnerability and SELinux

The Shellshock vulnerability is a bash exploit and the root issue is that you could put any command after the _env_ variable in a command , which allows an attacker to execute any arbitrary code. The following pictures shows an example of the bash exploit on an apache server.

image:images/lab2-shellshock-1.png[]

If you had a _cgi_ script accessing user data or the internal network, then this script could compromise either the internal network or user data on your system.

_So what can SELinux do to mitigate the Shellshock bash exploit?_

The important fact to understand is that *SELinux does not block the exploit* but it will *prevent escalation of confined domains*. These confined domains are defined by the SELinux policy installed on a system. Because *SELinux controls on their types (SELinux labels)*, the process is doing what it was designed to do and can not access what is not allowed in the SELinux policy.

The picture below shows the situation described above with SELinux enabled and in enforcing mode.

image:images/lab2-shellshock-2.png[]

If an attacker executed the potential _cgi_ script mentioned earlier, the attacker would not be able to access either user data or certain parts of the internal network as it is defined in the SELinux policy.

How is this done in reality? How do types, which ensure described process separation, look in reality? The below exercises will help answer these questions.

== Lab 2.1 Exploiting Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with the Shellshock vulnerability

=== Goal of Lab 2.1
In this first exercise, let's become a hacker and try to exploit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 with the Shellshock vulnerability.

As an administrator of Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, I want to enable SELinux for the web servers in my environment to mitigate damages caused by zero day vulnerabilities.

This lab exercise is split into three steps:

. Exploiting a RHEL system with SELinux in Permissive mode
. Exploiting a RHEL system with SELinux in Enforcing mode
. Analyzing SELinux denials

=== Lab 2.1.1 Logging into the *selinux1.example.com* system and navigating to the selinux scripts directory

The exploit will be executed from the _selinux1.example.com_ system.

. If not already there, log into to the bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. If not already root, become *root* and then log into the _selinux1.example.com_ system.
+
[source]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@selinux1.example.com

. Move to directory /root/selinux_scripts/ where are all the scripts needed to perform the attack.

    [root@selinux1 ~]# cd /root/selinux_scripts
+
NOTE: If you'd like copies of these selinux_scripts, they can also be found in this github link https://github.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/tree/master/RHELSecurityLabSummit/selinux_scripts[here^].

. Repeat steps #1-3 above on a second terminal (this terminal window will also be connected to *selinux1.example.com*)

=== Lab 2.1.2 Exploiting the system with SELinux in Permissive mode

==== Goal of Lab 2.1.2
In this part of the lab exercise, we are going to utilize the two open terminals from the previous exercise.
(both selinux1.example.com). The first terminal window will be for listening on 9999 tcp port and the second terminal window will be for executing the exploit script.

==== Introduction
Let's see this visually. Take a look at the image below. This image describes the flow of how the exploit that will be executed. On the left side is the victim server (selinux4 system). From the attacker machine (which is the selinux1 system), a http request will be sent and part of this http request will be to open the shell to the attacker machine listening on tcp port 9999.

image:images/lab2-shellshock-flow.png[]


==== Lab 2.1.2 exercise steps
Now let's go through the steps we just described above.

. Go to your two opened terminals that are connected to the *selinux1.example.com* systems and pointed to the /root/selinux_scripts directory.

. Note that the victim server, _selinux4_, has SELinux in permissive mode by default. It is running the Apache service running with an older version of bash. Everything is ready to run the exploit.

. Based on flow of the ShellShock attack we learned about earlier, it's necessary to start listening on tcp port 9999 on one of the selinux1 terminals you have opened. We'll be using Ncat, which is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# nc -lvp 9999
    Ncat: Version 7.50 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
    Ncat: Listening on :::9999
    Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:9999

. Now, from the other *selinux1* terminal, let's run the exploit:

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ./shellshock_exploit.sh

. Now, on the terminal where nc command was executed, a bash prompt should now appear.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# nc -lvp 9999
    Ncat: Version 7.50 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
    Ncat: Listening on :::9999
    Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:9999
    Ncat: Connection from 192.168.0.24.
    Ncat: Connection from 192.168.0.24:38668.
    bash: no job control in this shell
    bash-4.2$

. For testing purpose, few commands could be executed on the victim system (_selinux4_). Type *id* and then type *uname -a*. Then type *exit*.

    bash-4.2$ id
    id
    uid=48(apache) gid=48(apache) groups=48(apache) context=system_u:system_r:httpd_sys_script_t:s0
    bash-4.2$ uname -a
    uname -a
    Linux selinux4.example.com 3.10.0-418.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu May 26 20:35:02 EDT 2016 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
    bash-4.2$ exit

* The _id_ command prints real and effective user and group IDs, where we could see that user and group is apache. This is because cgi scripts are started as the apache owner.
* The _uname_ command prints system information. You can see the hostname *selinux4.example.com* being printed, which indicates that this is the victim system. These commands prove that the attack was successful.

=== Lab 2.1.3 Set SELinux to enforcing mode

The victim server (_selinux4_ system) has SELinux in permissive mode. Now, let's switch SELinux to enforcing and repeat the attack.

Connect to _selinux4_ and switch to Enforcing mode

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux4 setenforce 1

=== Lab 2.1.4 Exploiting system with SELinux in Enforcing mode

Now, let's repeat the attack but this time with SELinux in Enforcing mode on the victim server (_selinux4_ ).

Based on flow of the _ShellShock_ attack, let's again start listening on tcp port 9999 on one of the terminals for the _selinux1_ system.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# nc -lvp 9999
    Ncat: Version 7.50 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
    Ncat: Listening on :::9999
    Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:9999

_Ncat_ is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line.

Now, from another terminal for the selinux1 system, let's run the exploit again.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ./shellshock_exploit.sh

As you can see, this time around, there is no bash prompt on the terminal where you executed the _nc_ command. This is because SELinux blocked this access. SELinux did its job!

=== Lab 2.1.5 Analyzing the SELinux denial

Let's analyze what happened and why SELinux blocked the ShellShock exploit.

Connect to the selinux4 system from the selinux1 machine

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux4
    [root@selinux4 ~]# ausearch -m AVC -ts today | grep name_connect
    type=AVC msg=audit(1524909646.681:86): avc:  denied  { name_connect } for  pid=2091 comm="bashbug.sh" dest=9999 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_sys_script_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:jboss_management_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket

This is the avc record from the Audit daemon. This output is saying that the cgi script, called bashbug.sh , labeled as httpd_sys_script_t tried to connect to tcp port 9999 labeled as jboss_management_port_t. Fortunately, there is no allow rules for this access. As a result, the access was denied by the kernel and SELinux mitigated this attack.

== Lab 2.2 Exploiting Fedora 27 with the Runcescape vulnerability

=== Goal of Lab 2.2
In this second exercise, let's become a hacker and try to exploit Fedora 27 with the Runcescape vulnerability.

Old release of Fedora27 was used for the purpose, because docker is fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Fedora27 is in end of life state, which means no updates are provided, so docker there is still vulnerable.

As an administrator of Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers, I want to enable SELinux for the containers in my environment to mitigate damages caused by zero day vulnerabilities.

This lab exercise is split into three steps:

. Exploiting a Fedora system with SELinux in Enforcing mode
. Exploiting a Fedora system with SELinux in Permissive mode
. Analyzing SELinux denials

=== Lab 2.2.1 Logging into the *selinux6.example.com* system and navigating to the selinux directory

The exploit will be executed from the _selinux6.example.com_ system.

. If not already there, log into to the bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
[source]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. If not already root, become *root* and then log into the _selinux6.example.com_ system.
[source]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@selinux6.example.com

. Move to directory /root/selinux_scripts/ where are all the scripts needed to perform the attack.
[source]
[root@selinux6 ~]# cd /root/selinux_scripts


NOTE: If you'd like copies of these selinux_scripts, they can also be found in this github link https://github.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos/tree/master/RHELSecurityLabSummit/selinux_scripts[here^].

==== Introduction
CVE-2019-5736 runc escape is the latest vulnerability in containers world. It's privilege escalation vulnerability with arbitrary code execution as root, when malicious process inside container will escape from container namespace and will execute arbitary code on host system. This is really dangerous because in any container could be malicious process and when system administrator will start the container, they will add root access to the whole system.
Fortunately, SELinux technology, which separates containers between each other and also separates containers from the host system, blocks this exploit.

NOTE: If you'd like to read more about this exploit, information can be found in this link https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/runcescape[here^].

==== Lab 2.2.2 exercise steps
Now, let's follow these steps to reproduce the attack.

. First step is to check if the host system is running SELinux in *enforcing* state.
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# sestatus
SELinux status:                 enabled
SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
Loaded policy name:             targeted
Current mode:                   enforcing
Mode from config file:          enforcing
Policy MLS status:              enabled
Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
Memory protection checking:     actual (secure)
Max kernel policy version:      31

. Second step is to prepare the environment, for this purpose there is *runcescape.sh* shell script prepared for you. The script will install and start docker container engine. This engine also uses a vulnerable runc bundled inside. Then regular container with the latest ubuntu distribution will be downloaded. Next step is to upload malicious program to container and prepare the exploit. Let's execute the script:
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# ./runcescape.sh
[+] Installing docker
[+] Starting docker
[+] Downloading container
[+] Uploading exploit
[+] Executing docker

. Now, container with malicious program is ready, and waiting for system administrator who will execute the program inside the container. In this case, malicious program is renamed to _bash_ and replaced with the real _/bin/bash_. Let's execute it inside the container:
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash
[+] bad_libseccomp.so booted.
[+] opened ro /proc/self/exe <3>.
[+] constructed fdpath </proc/self/fd/3>
[+] bad_init is ready -- see </tmp/bad_init_log> for logs.
[*] dying to allow /proc/self/exe to be unused...

. Because of type of the attack, sometimes it's necessary to execute the last command multiple times, so to make sure the attack is successful execute the latest command _docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash_ multiple times.

=== Lab 2.2.3 Analyzing the SELinux denial

Let's analyze what happened and why SELinux blocked the runc escape exploit.

Run _ausearch_ command to see SELinux denial:
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# ausearch -m AVC -ts today | grep container_runtime_exec_t
type=AVC msg=audit(1554464510.001:479): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=5190 comm="bad_init" name="docker-runc-current" dev="dm-0" ino=9162730 scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c915,c946 tcontext=system_u:object_r:container_runtime_exec_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0

This is the avc record from the Audit daemon. This output is saying that malicious process inside the container *bad_init* labeled as *container_t* is trying to modify *docker-runc-current* labeled as *container_runtime_exec_t* on host system. This is clearly not good and should be blocked, what SELinux did.

=== Lab 2.2.4 Set SELinux to permissive mode

The _selinux6_ system has SELinux in enforcing mode. Now, let's switch SELinux to permissive and repeat the attack.
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# setenforce 0
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# getenforce
Permissive

==== Lab 2.2.5 exercise steps in permissive mode
Now, let's follow these steps again to reproduce the attack in permissive mode.

. First step is to prepare new container with the exploit
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# ./runcescape.sh
[+] Installing docker
[+] Starting docker
[+] Downloading container
[+] Uploading exploit
[+] Executing docker

. Now, container with malicious program is ready, and waiting for system administrator who will execute the program inside the container. In this case, malicious program is renamed to _bash_ and replaced with the real _/bin/bash_. Let's repeat the attack, now it will be successful because SELinux is in permissive mode.
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash
[+] bad_libseccomp.so booted.
[+] opened ro /proc/self/exe <3>.
[+] constructed fdpath </proc/self/fd/3>
[+] bad_init is ready -- see </tmp/bad_init_log> for logs.
[*] dying to allow /proc/self/exe to be unused...

. Because of type of the attack, sometimes it's necessary to execute the last command multiple times, so to make sure the attack is successful execute the latest command _docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash_ multiple until you'll see this output:
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash
rpc error: code = 2 desc = containerd: container not started

This is a proof that exploit was successful. Output of command _ausearch -m AVC -ts today_ will again show same SELinux denial, like in Enforcing but because we're in permissive also payload of exploit is executed. In our case, payload creates file in root filesystem with name *HACKED*. Let's prove it:
[source]
[root@selinux6 selinux_scripts]# cd /
[root@selinux6 /]# ls
bin   dev  HACKED  lib    media  opt   root  sbin  sys  usr
boot  etc  home    lib64  mnt    proc  run   srv   tmp  var

File with name *HACKED* is there. Of course, this is just an example, instead of creating file in /, there can be arbitary code execution.

== Lab 2.3 Enabling SELinux via Ansible

=== Goal of Lab 2.3

SELinux brings additional security for your environment and very often needs to be further modified to reflect the current environment configuration. For these cases, SELinux can be switched to Permissive mode as a debugging mode to not block basic functionality of systems. With this mode, we can run for a time period to debug all possible SELinux AVC denials, which makes turning SELinux on easier to manage. There are many ways to view or modify the installed SELinux policy.

In this lab, we used the SELinux Ansible role to distribute all needed changes in the SELinux policy to make our Apache configuration working with SELinux in Enforcing mode.

Specifically, in this lab exercise, you will enable SELinux in your environment, which consists of an Apache server using both custom and standard paths for web files. You will enable SELinux so that your Apache server is fully confined by SELinux. Specifically, you will use the SELinux system roles feature as an Ansible role to configure SELinux in an automated fashion.

=== Introduction and Lab Background Info

In this lab exercise, you have an environment with Apache web servers,  where both default and custom paths for Apache web files are used. Specifically:

 * /var/www/html (default)
 * /var/www_new/html (custom)

These web files are accessible using tcp/80 and tcp/7070 ports on each web server.

 * selinux2.example.com:80 (default)
 * selinux2.example.com:7070 (custom)

 * selinux3.example.com:80 (default)
 * selinux3.example.com:7070 (custom)

 * selinux5.example.com:80 (default)
 * selinux5.example.com:7070 (custom)

SELinux is disabled for all web servers by default. In a fully automated fashion, you will turn SELinux on for all web servers without breaking any functionality using the SELinux system roles feature as an Ansible role.

The SELinux part of the lab environment consists of four machines:

 * selinux1, selinux1.example.com (RHEL-8 admin host)
 * selinux2, selinux2.example.com (RHEL-8 host)
 * selinux3, selinux3.example.com (RHEL-6 host)
 * selinux5, selinux5.example.com (RHEL-7 host)

The first _selinux1.example.com_ host will be used as an admin interface to setup the other two hosts where we will complete all our configuration steps.

===  Pre-Configured Set Up Steps (Already done for you)

*Important*: All steps in this _Pre-Configured Set Up Steps_ section have been already performed in the lab environment for you. They are mentioned from an informative purpose and they ONLY need to executed if you use the revert script for this lab

==== Viewing basic environment pre-configuration information

Let's take a look at what has been pre-configured for you in this part of the lab exercise.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. Log into the _selinux1.example.com_ system as *root*.
+
[source]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@selinux1.example.com

. Look at the DNS records on the _selinux1_ server.
[source]
[root@selinux1 ~]# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
192.168.0.20 selinux2
192.168.0.21 selinux3
192.168.0.6 selinux5

.  The __ansible__ package has been installed on the _selinux1_ host.
[source]
[root@selinux1 ~]# pip3 install ansible

. Enter the _selinux_scripts_ working directory on the _selinux1_ host.
[source]
[root@selinux1 ~]# cd /root/selinux_scripts

. Look at the created inventory file for our Ansible usage.
[source]
[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# cat inventory
selinux2 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/libexec/platform-python
selinux3
selinux5

==== Pre-Configuration of Apache web servers with SELinux disabled

The _apache_ web servers were set up using the _setup-webserver.yml_ playbook and this playbook was executed on the _selinux2_,  _selinux3_ and _selinux5_ hosts.  SELinux was also turned off.

All ansible commands below were executed from _selinux1.example.com_.

Test whether all servers are available via the _ansible_ command.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. If not already root, become *root* and then log into the _selinux1.example.com_ system.
+
[source]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@selinux1.example.com

. Enter the _selinux_scripts_ working directory on the _selinux1_ host.
[source]
[root@selinux1 ~]# cd /root/selinux_scripts

. Now let's test which servers are accessible.
+
[source]
[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible all -i inventory -m ping -u root

. An Ansible script will pass all listed servers in the _inventory_ file and will send a test to see if they are accessible. All servers should return a pong response.

    selinux3 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    selinux5 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }
    selinux2 | SUCCESS => {
        "changed": false,
        "ping": "pong"
    }

. Apache web servers were configured on given servers via the _setup_webserver.yml_ playbook.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root setup-webserver.yml

The following actions were performed for all hosts mentioned in the _inventory_ file:

 * SELinux was disabled.
 * Apache webservers were
  ** installed
  ** configured to listen on _tcp/80_ and _tcp/7070_ ports via the _linux-sytem-roles/firewall_ ansible role.
  ** configured to use two root directories for web files,

	/var/www/html (default)
	/var/www_new/html (custom)

  ** were rebooted,

At the end we installed the _setools-console_ package containing SELinux policy query tools which will be used for SELinux Troubleshooting.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2 yum install setools-console -y

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux3 yum install setools-console -y

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux5 yum install setools-console -y

=== Lab 2.3.1 Testing the pre-configured setup
In this section, we are going to test our pre-configured setup steps from before.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# hostname
	selinux1.example.com

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# cd /root/selinux_scripts

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# curl selinux{2,3,5}
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# curl selinux{2,3,5}:7070
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2 getenforce
	Disabled
	
    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux3 getenforce
	Disabled
	
    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux5 getenforce
	Disabled


=== Lab 2.3.2 Turning SELinux On

. Setup SELinux to _permissive_ mode and relabel the whole filesystem.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root enable-selinux.yml


. SELinux is switched to _permissive_ mode using the _enable-selinux_ playbook. It means that SELinux policy is enabled but is not enforced. We can use the _getenforce_ and _sestatus_ utility to view the current SELinux mode for our server(s).

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2 getenforce
    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2 sestatus

. SELinux does not deny access, but denials are logged for actions that would have been denied if running in enforcing mode. In order to show logged denials for certain actions we need to run the _curl_ command. AVC denial(s) will be generated and we can view it via the _ausearch_ command below.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# curl selinux{2,3,5}:7070
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2

	[root@selinux2 ~]# ausearch -m AVC -su httpd_t -ts recent

	avc:  denied  { name_bind } for  pid=1830 comm="httpd" src=7070 scontext=system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:unreserved_port_t:s0 tclass=tcp_socket

=== Lab 2.3.3 SELinux Troubleshooting
In the previous step, we turned SELinux on and got AVC denials. Denial messages are logged when SELinux denies access. Let's find out why we got these AVC denials.

SELinux Troubleshooting can be performed on both the _selinux2_ and _selinux3_ hosts. We will use the _selinux2_ host for the following examples.

. Log into the _selinux2_ host, if you're not already logged in.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh root@selinux2

==== Lab 2.3.3.1 SELinux Port

. SELinux _httpd_t_ process domain used for Apache web servers is not able to bind to _tcp/7070_ port by default. There is no default rule for this access in the SELinux policy on the RHEL-7 _selinux5_ and RHEL-8 _selinux2_ hosts.

  [root@selinux2 ~]# sesearch -A -s httpd_t -t unreserved_port_t -c tcp_socket -p name_bind | grep httpd_t

. Compare to that Apache webservers can bind to other ports and these SELinux port types can be assigned to our selected custom port (_tcp/7070_).

  [root@selinux2 ~]# sesearch -A -s httpd_t -c tcp_socket -p name_bind | grep httpd_t

==== Lab 2.3.3.2 SELinux File context

. SELinux _httpd_t_ process domain used for Apache webservers is not able to read a general _/var_ content with SELinux _var_t_ file type. There is no rule for this access in the SELinux policy.

	[root@selinux2 ~]# sesearch -A -s httpd_t -t var_t -c file -p read

. Compare to that Apache webservers can read a specific content with a specific SELinux file type.

	[root@selinux2 ~]# sesearch -A -s httpd_t -c file -p read

. We can use the matchpathcon utility to decide what should be a proper context for our alternative location for web files.

	[root@selinux2 ~]# matchpathcon /var/www/html
	/var/www/html    system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0
	[root@selinux2 ~]# exit

=== Lab 2.3.4 Viewing and Executing the SELinux _setup-selinux.yml_ ansible playbook

We will execute an SELinux Ansible playbook which will switch SELinux to Enforcing mode and apply all needed changes for our web servers' configuration.

The playbook uses the linux-system-roles/selinux Ansible role.

Let's take a quick look at this Ansible playbook.

. Make sure you are on the *selinux1* system and navigate to the /root/selinux_scripts directory.

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# hostname
	selinux1.example.com

	[root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# pwd
	/root/selinux_scripts

. Open the *setup-selinux.yml* Ansible playbook.

  [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# cat setup-selinux.yml
----
  - hosts: all
  become: true
  become_user: root
  vars:
    SELinux_type: targeted
    SELinux_mode: enforcing
    SELinux_change_running: 1
    SELinux_file_contexts:
       - { target: '/var/www_new(/.*)?', setype: 'httpd_sys_content_t', ftype: 'a' }
    SELinux_restore_dirs:
      - /var/www/html
      - /var/www_new/
    SELinux_ports:
      - { ports: '7070', proto: 'tcp', setype: 'http_port_t', state: 'present' }
  roles:
    - linux-system-roles.selinux
----

. Let's take a closer look at the _setup_selinux.yml_ Ansible playbook.

* In the _vars_ section, we are switching SELinux to Enforcing mode.

    SELinux_type: targeted
    SELinux_mode: enforcing
    SELinux_change_running: 1

* Webservers use the custom _/var/www_new/html_ path for web pages. SELinux labels have to be fixed for this directory and sub directories/files to reflect the default SELinux security labels for the _/var/www/html_ location. It is ensured by the following lines in the playbook:

    SELinux_file_contexts:
        - { target: '/var/www_new(/.*)?', setype: 'httpd_sys_content_t', ftype: 'a' }

* Once SELinux security labels are defined in the SELinux context database, these labels should be applied into extended attributes of selected files.  It is ensured by the following lines in the playbook:

    SELinux_restore_dirs:
        - /var/www_new

* All web servers are binded to the custom _tcp/7070_ port in our configuration. This setup needs to be reflected in a SELinux configuration. It is ensured by the following lines in the playbook:

    SELinux_ports:
        - { ports: '7070', proto: 'tcp', setype: 'http_port_t', state: 'present' }

. Now let's execute this _setup_selinux.yml_ Ansible playbook and apply these defined configurations for all servers.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root setup-selinux.yml

=== Lab 2.3.5 Viewing all SELinux configuration changes

. Now let's test and view all our recent SELinux configuration changes.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh selinux2 semanage export

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh selinux5 semanage export

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ssh selinux3 semanage -o -

. Check the current SELinux status for all servers..

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible all -i inventory -u root -a getenforce

. Check the functionality with enabled SELinux.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# curl selinux{2,3,5}
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Default Document Root</h1>

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# curl selinux{2,3,5}:7070
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>
	<h1>Custom Document Root</h1>

== Revert script

This step is required for the next lab exercise.

Also, for those of you that want to re-do this lab exercise from the beginning, you can run this revert script. All the steps in the _Pre-Configured Set-Up_ steps section mentioned in the beginning of this lab will need to be executed , with the exception of the package installation steps.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# hostname
    selinux1.example.com

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# pwd
    /root/selinux_scripts

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# cat inventory
    selinux2 ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/libexec/platform-python
    selinux3
    selinux5

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root revert-all.yml

== Lab 2.4 How to set up a system with SELinux confined users

=== Goal of Lab 2.4
As an enterprise system administrator, I may want my systems to follow the US Department of Defense STIG security rule V-71971 so that my system will be fully confined without unconfined users.
I also would only want one administrator user who can become root and manage the system, and limit the access of other users.

This lab exercise is split into three steps:

. Confine regular Linux users
. Confine Linux root users
. Revert script

=== Introduction
In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Linux users are mapped to the SELinux _unconfined_u_ user by default. All processes run by _unconfined_u_ are in the _unconfined_t_ domain. This means that users can access across the system within the limits of the standard Linux DAC policy. However, a number of confined SELinux users are available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. This means that users can be restricted to limited set of capabilities. Each Linux user is mapped to an SELinux user using SELinux policy, allowing Linux users to inherit the restrictions placed on SELinux users.

=== Lab 2.4.1 Confine regular Linux users

. Make sure that the "revert script" from previous step was executed.

    [root@selinux1 selinux_scripts]# ansible-playbook -i inventory -u root revert-all.yml

. All actions are performed on the _selinux5_ host , which is a RHEL 7.5 system.

. If not already there, log into to the bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

. Log into the _selinux1.example.com_ system as root.
+
[source]
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]# ssh root@selinux1.example.com
[root@selinux1 ~]# ssh root@selinux5.example.com

. Linux users can be assigned to SELinux users using semanage login tool. By default users are mapped to _unconfined_u_:

    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage login -l

==== Lab 2.4.1.1 Change the default mapping

. In order to change mapping all Linux users we need to modify the record with __default__ which represents all users without explicit mapping.

_system_u_ is a special user used only for system processes and in the future will not be listed.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage login -m -s user_u -r s0 __default__
    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage login -l

==== Lab 2.4.1.2 Add a test user

. After this, when users (not root) logs in, their processes will run the _user_t_ domain. Every user session but root will run with _user_t_:

    [root@selinux5 ~]# adduser user42

    [root@selinux5 ~]# passwd user42
    (Feel free to pick whatever password you want for user42. But, be sure to pick a password you can remember.)

    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh user42@localhost
    user42@localhost's password:
    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ id -Z
    user_u:user_r:user_t:s0

    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ ps axZ
    LABEL                     PID TTY    STAT  TIME COMMAND
    -                           1 ?      Ss    0:00 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 21
    user_u:user_r:user_t:s0  2780 ?      S     0:00 sshd: user42@pts/1
    user_u:user_r:user_t:s0  2781 pts/1  Ss    0:00 -bash
    user_u:user_r:user_t:s0  2808 pts/1  R+    0:00 ps axZ

    # exit

. Now we can try if the user can become root.

. Let's add this line to the /etc/sudoers.d/administrators file:
user42  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

    [root@selinux5 ~]# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/administrators

. In the text editor, Press *i* to insert and copy and paste this line into the text editor:
+
  user42  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL

. Next, press *esc* and then press *:wq!* to save and exit.
. Let's confirm our changes.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# grep user42 /etc/sudoers.d/administrators
    user42  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL


    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh user42@localhost
    user42@localhost's password:
    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ sudo -i
    sudo: PERM_SUDOERS: setresuid(-1, 1, -1): Operation not permitted
    sudo: no valid sudoers sources found, quitting
    sudo: setresuid() [0, 0, 0] -> [1001, -1, -1]: Operation not permitted
    sudo: unable to initialize policy plugin

. And the same attempt in permissive mode:

    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ exit
    [root@selinux5 ~]# id -Z
    unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

    [root@selinux5 ~]# setenforce 0
    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh user42@localhost

    user42@localhost's password:
    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ sudo -i
    [root@selinux5 ~]# id
    uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) context=user_u:user_r:user_t:s0

    [root@selinux5 ~]# id -Z
    User_u:user_r:user_t:s0

    [root@selinux5 ~]# exit

    [user42@selinux5 ~]$ exit
    [root@selinux5 ~]# setenforce 1

Since SELinux denials are not enforced in permissive mode, _user42_ can become root but we can see that the context stayed _user_t_ and didn't change to _unconfined_t_.

=== Lab 2.4.2 Confined Administrator

. There are two basic methods for confining the administator user:

* Administrator can be directly mapped to _sysadm_u_ SELinux user so that when such user logs in, the session will be run with _sysadm_t_ domain. In this case you need to enable the _ssh_sysadm_login_ SELinux boolean in order to allow users assigned _sysadm_u_ to login using ssh.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage user -m -R "sysadm_r secadm_r" sysadm_u
    [root@selinux5 ~]# adduser -G wheel -Z sysadm_u admin1

    [root@selinux5 ~]# passwd admin1
    (Feel free to pick whatever password you want for admin1. But, be sure to pick a password you can remember.)

    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage login -l | grep admin
    admin1               sysadm_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *

    [root@selinux5 ~]# setsebool -P ssh_sysadm_login on
    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh admin1@localhost

    [admin1@selinux5 ~]$ id -Z
    sysadm_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

    [admin1@selinux5 ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for admin1:


    [root@selinux5 ~]# id -Z
    sysadm_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

** Now we can try to perform admin's operation which can be executed only by admin SELinux users.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# systemctl restart sshd
    [root@selinux5 ~]# exit
    [admin1@selinux5 ~]# exit

* The other way is to assign u administer users to _staff_u_ and configure _sudo_ so that particular users can gain SELinux administrator role.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# adduser -G wheel -Z staff_u admin2

    [root@selinux5 ~]# passwd admin2
    (Feel free to pick whatever password you want for admin1. But, be sure to pick a password you can remember.)

    [root@selinux5 ~]# semanage login -l | grep admin
    admin1               sysadm_u             s0-s0:c0.c1023       *
    admin2               staff_u              s0-s0:c0.c1023       *


    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh admin2@localhost
    [admin2@selinux5 ~]$ id -Z
    staff_u:staff_r:staff_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

    [admin2@selinux5 ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for admin2:
    -bash: /root/.bash_profile: Permission denied
    -bash-4.2# id -Z
    staff_u:staff_r:staff_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023


. Now we can again try to perform administrator's operation which can be executed only by administrator SELinux users.

    -bash-4.2# systemctl restart sshd
    Failed to restart sshd.service: Access denied
    See system logs and 'systemctl status sshd.service' for details.
    -bash-4.2# exit
    [admin2@selinux5 ~]$ exit

. To allow admin2 user to gain SELinux administrator role you need to add the following rule to sudoers.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/administrators

. Append following line to end of file.  In the text editor, Press *o* then copy and paste these lines below into the text editor. Then, press *esc* and then press *:wq!* to save and exit.

    admin2  ALL=(ALL)  TYPE=sysadm_t ROLE=sysadm_r    ALL
    admin2  ALL=(ALL)  TYPE=secadm_t ROLE=secadm_r /usr/sbin/semanage,/usr/sbin/semodule

. Admin2 can gain administrator role using sudo now.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# ssh admin2@localhost
    [admin2@selinux5 ~]$ sudo -i
    [sudo] password for admin2:

    [root@selinux5 ~]# id -Z
    staff_u:sysadm_r:sysadm_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

    [root@selinux5 ~]# systemctl restart sshd
    [root@selinux5 ~]#

    [root@selinux5 ~]# exit
    [admin2@selinux5 ~]# exit

== Revert script

There is a revert script to restore the default SELinux Users configuration. If you want to run this revert script, run it on the _selinux5_ host.

    [root@selinux5 ~]# hostname
    selinux5.example.com

    [root@selinux5 ~]# cd /root
    [root@selinux5 ~]# sh confined_users_revert.sh
