:imagesdir: images


== 1.1 Introduction

In this lab, you become familiar with the `ComplianceAsCode` project. The purpose of this project is to help users create security policy content for various platforms. The `ComplianceAsCode` project enables users to efficiently develop and share security content.

Using the powerful build system, you can generate output in various formats such as Ansible^(R)^ Playbooks or SCAP datastreams
that you can use to automate security auditing and hardening.
The project contains many useful rules and checks that form various security policies and enables users to easily add new rules and checks.

You work with the project source repository at link:https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content[https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content^].

In Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ (RHEL), the SCAP content generated from `ComplianceAsCode` data is shipped as the `scap-security-guide` RPM package.

.*Goals*

* Learn about the `ComplianceAsCode` project to understand what is where and what you can use the project for.
* Learn how to build the content from the source and go through what gets built.
* Understand how to find the source of a particular part of the built artifact.
* Learn how to parametrize rules that use variables.
* Learn where to find additional rule content, such as checks and remediations.


.*Preconfigured Lab Environment*

* The `ComplianceAsCode` repository is already cloned to all of the `/home/lab-user/labs/` directories. For example, `/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction` is a clone of the `ComplianceAsCode` project repository.
* The following required dependencies for the `ComplianceAsCode` content build are already installed using `yum install`:
** Generic build utilities: `cmake` and `make`
** Utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`
** Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml` and `python3-jinja2`


== 1.2 Hands-on Lab

The `ComplianceAsCode` project consists of human-readable files that are compiled into standard-compliant files that are difficult to read and edit directly.

For your convenience, the environment is already set up, so the content is built and ready to be used.
No worries, though--you get to rebuild it later in the exercise.

To start the hands-on section, take the following steps:

. Log in to the VM using the text console if you have not done so already.
+
.. Go to the Terminal window on your laptop.
.. Use SSH to access the remote VM as `lab-user`.
Do not forget to replace `GUID` with your lab-provided GUID! Type *r3dh4t1!* for the password.
+
----
[... ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$
----

. Go to the text console (Terminal window) on your laptop and
navigate to `/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction`:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[... lab1_introduction]$
----


=== 1.2.1 Viewing the HTML Guides for the `ComplianceAsCode` Project

The `ComplianceAsCode` project provides HTML guides that are a great resource for those interested in the rules that make up a policy.
The HTML guides are located in the respective `build/guides` of each lab exercise subdirectory. Therefore, the full path of the directory for this lab exercise is:

----
/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction/build/guides/
----

In the `ComplianceAsCode` project, policies are referred to as security profiles.
The HTML guide filenames have a `ssg-<product>-guide-<profile>.html` format, so the HTML guide for the RHEL 8 Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems (OSPP profile) is `ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html`.

. Now, take a look at one of the provided HTML guides in a web browser.
.. Go back to the console of your lab VM by going to the tab that you opened of the lab environment's *power control and consoles page* in Lab 0.
If you need to log in again as *Lab User*, the password is *r3dh4t1!*.
+
image::vmconsole.png[200,200]

.. On the remote desktop, you open the guide in a web browser.
Click `Activities` at the top left of your desktop and click the "file cabinet" icon to open the file explorer.
+
image::desktopfilefolder.png[100,100]

.. After the window appears, click the `Home` icon in the top left portion of the file explorer window.
.. Then, navigate to the location of the exercise by double-clicking the `labs` folder, followed by double-clicking the
`lab1_introduction`, `build`, and `guides` folders.
.. As a last step, double-click the `ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp-rhel8.html` file to open the HTML guide for the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.
+
image::navigateospp.png[1000,1000]

. Rules are organized in a system of hierarchical groups. Take a look through this HTML guide to see the various rules of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.
+

=== 1.2.2 Updating a Rule Description to Find the Source of a Specific Rule

You now take a closer look at a specific rule in the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile.
For example, take a closer look at the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule entry.

. In the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile that you opened in Firefox, press `Ctrl+F` and search for `session timeout`.
+
.The *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule in the RHEL 8 OSPP profile HTML guide
image::session_timeout.png[]

. Review the description just below the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule:
+
----
Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that all user
sessions will terminate based on inactivity. The TMOUT setting in /etc/profile should read as follows:

TMOUT=1800
----
+
Note that some text is incorrectly written twice in this rule: *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that*. This was done on purpose for you to fix, so you can understand how rule definitions are created and updated.

. Locate this duplicated rule-definition text.
+
Rule definitions for Linux systems are under the `linux_os/guide` directory of the `ComplianceAsCode` project.
Remember that the `ComplianceAsCode` project was already cloned to all of the `/home/lab-user/labs/*` directories.
So, for example, `/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction` is a clone of the `ComplianceAsCode` project repository.
Because there are about 1,000 rules, it is better to search all of the rules for the text, rather than trying to find a particular rule in the directory hierarchy by browsing it.
+
Rule definitions are written as YAML files, which are particularly suited for storing key-value data.
All rules are defined by the respective `rule.yml` file, and the parent directory is the respective rule’s ID.
The ID of the rule in question is `accounts_tmout`. Given that, you can search for the directory.

. Make sure you are in the `/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction` directory, then execute the following *find* command.
This command searches for a file or directory with the exact name `accounts_tmout` in the directory subtree below the `linux_os` directory.
Expect to see the following output after typing the find command:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[... lab1_introduction]$ find linux_os -name accounts_tmout
linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
----
+
Note that the `linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout` directory was reported as the result, and the rule is defined in the `rule.yml` file in that directory.

. Open the `rule.yml` file so you can remove the duplicate text that you saw earlier: *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that*:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[... lab1_introduction]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/rule.yml
----

. Luckily, the rule’s description is right at the beginning of the `rule.yml` file.
Remove the duplicate occurrence of *Setting the <tt>TMOUT</tt> option in <tt>/etc/profile</tt> ensures that*.
. Press `Ctrl+X` to bring up the "save and exit" option, and confirm that you want to save the changes and exit by entering `y`.

. Recompile the content to check whether your fix worked.
+
The link:https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content[ComplianceAsCode/content^] project uses the link:https://cmake.org/[CMake^] build system.
The build itself is based on Python, the `oscap` tool, and XSLT transformations.

.. Make sure that you are in the `/home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction` directory in the Terminal window of your laptop.
.. From this directory, run `./build_product rhel8` to compile content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8
----
+
It is also possible to build content for other products.
A product can be an operating system, such as RHEL 8, RHEL 7, or Fedora, or an application, such as Firefox or Java(TM).
+
In general, you can run `./build_product <product>` to build only the content for a product you are interested in.
The `<product>` is the lowercase form of the product, so you run `./build_product rhel8` to build content for RHEL 8, `./build_product fedora` to build content for Fedora, and so on.
+

. Go back to the HTML guide of the RHEL 8 OSPP profile that you opened earlier, and
refresh your web browser.

. Review the fix.
Expect to now see the fixed description, without the duplicate *Setting the TMOUT option in /etc/profile ensures that* text, if you scroll down to the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule.


=== 1.2.3 Customizing a Parametrized Rule

In this lab exercise, you learn about parametrized rules.
Parametrization can be used to set timeout durations, password length, umask, and other settings.
You learn about parametrized rules by:

- Observing where the value comes from
- Changing the parametrized rule to see how it is applied
- Observing what happens when the parametrized variable is omitted

{empty}

. Modifying parametrized rules is very easy, as this rule does not have the timeout duration hard-coded--it is parametrized by a variable.
As the description for the *Set Interactive Session Timeout* rule says, the rule uses the `timeout` variable.
This is defined in the `var_accounts_tmout.var` file.
Just as you did in the previous step, you can search for the variable definition:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ find linux_os -name var_accounts_tmout.var
linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/var_accounts_tmout.var
----
+
Though the `var_accounts_tmout.var` file contains the variable description--which is helpful--you cannot be sure what the number `1800` means. However, the contents of the file indicate that it is the same as 30 minutes, which is 1800 seconds.

. The rule is parametrized per profile.
This is because there can be multiple profiles in one datastream file, one rule can exist in multiple profiles, and it can be parametrized differently in different profiles.
+
To see how the rule is connected to its variable, you have to review the respective profile definition, `rhel8/profiles/ospp.profile`.
Open it in the editor and search for `accounts_tmout`:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ nano rhel8/profiles/ospp.profile
----

.. In the editor, press `Ctrl+W` to search for `accounts_tmout`.
.. Then press `Alt+W` to jump to the next occurrence.
+
----
    ...
    ### FMT_MOF_EXT.1 / AC-11(a)
    ### Set Screen Lock Timeout Period to 30 Minutes or Less
    - accounts_tmout
    - var_accounts_tmout=30_min
    ...
----
. Modify the `var_accounts_tmout` variable to `10_min`.
.. Press `Ctrl+X`, then enter `y` to save and exit.
.. Rebuild the content:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8
----
+
After the build finishes, refresh the HTML guide either by reloading it in the browser, or by reopening `build/guides/ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html`.
Expect the variable value to be updated to `600`.
+

image::browser-refresh.png[500,500]

. What happens if you omit the variable definition?
.. Open the OSPP profile file in an editor.
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ nano rhel8/profiles/ospp.profile
----
.. Again, use `Ctrl+W` in connection with `Alt+W` in the editor to search for `accounts_tmout`.
.. Comment out the line containing `- var_accounts_tmout=30_min` by inserting `#` just before the leading dash.
.. After you are done,
press `Ctrl+X`, then enter `y` to save and exit.

.. Rebuild the content again:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8
----

.. After the build finishes, re-examine the variable definition--maybe you can predict the result without looking!
Open the variable definition in the editor and execute the following command:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/var_accounts_tmout.var
----
+
In this YAML file, you have the `options:` key that defines mappings between the supplied and effective values.
As the `default: 600` line indicates, if you do not specify the timeout duration in a profile, it is going to be 600 seconds (10 minutes).
.. After you are finished looking, press `Ctrl+X` to bring up the "save and exit" option.
If you are asked about saving any changes, you probably do not want that, so enter `n`.

.. Time to review the HTML guide--when refreshing or reopening `build/guides/ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html`, you can clearly see the rule's timeout indeed equals 600.

NOTE: The set of values a variable can have is discrete--all values have to be defined in the variable file.
Therefore, it is possible to specify `var_accounts_tmout=20_min` in the profile only after adding `20_min: 1200` to the `options:` key of the variable definition.


== 1.3 Associated Content

A rule needs more than a description to be of any use. You need to be able to:

* check whether the system complies with the rule definition, and
* restore an uncompliant system to a compliant state.

For these reasons, a rule should contain a check and possibly also remediations.
The additional content is placed in subdirectories of the rule, so explore your `accounts_tmout` rule.

You can browse the associated content if you list the contents of the directory.
In the terminal, run the following commands:

----
[... lab1_introduction]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ ls
ansible  bash  oval  rule.yml
----

The following sections describe the currently supported associated content types.


=== 1.3.1 Checks

Checks can be found under the `oval` directory.
They are written in an standardized, declarative, XML-based language called OVAL (Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language).
Writing checks in this language is considered cumbersome, but the `ComplianceAsCode` project helps users to write it more efficiently.

You do not get into the details of OVAL now--just note that the OVAL content can be found in a rule's `oval` subdirectory.
The OVAL checks are described in link:lab5_oval.adoc[Lab Exercise 5^].
// The browser cannot handle the XML file because there are namespaces that are not bound, so you are advised to open it with a text editor.
If you are familiar with the language, you can take this opportunity to examine the `oval` subdirectory of the `accounts_tmout` rule's directory containing the `shared.xml` file.
The `shared.xml` file features a shorthand OVAL, which is much simpler than the full version of OVAL that you otherwise have to write.


=== 1.3.2 Remediations

If the system is not set up according to the rule description, the scanner reports that the rule has failed, and the system administrator is supposed to fix it.
The `ComplianceAsCode` content provides users with snippets that they can run to make the system compliant again or at least provide administrators with hints about what they need to do.

Remediations are expected to work on the clean installation configuration--if the administrator has made some changes in the meantime, remediations are not guaranteed to work.

The majority of rules present in profiles come with a Bash remediation, and a large number of them have Ansible remediations.
Anaconda remediations are used to guide the user during system installation.
Remediations in the form of a Puppet script are also supported.

Remediations can be found under `bash`, `ansible`, `anaconda`, and `puppet` directories.

For example, in the `accounts_tmout` rule there is a remediation in the form of a Bash script located in the `bash` subdirectory of the rule's directory.
Run `ls bash` to display the contents of the `bash` directory--there is a `shared.sh` file in it.
The `shared` basename has a special meaning--it indicates that the remediation can be used with any product.
If the remediation is named `rhel8.sh`, it means that it is a RHEL8-only remediation and cannot be used to remediate RHEL7 systems.
This name coding is relevant for all types of additional content.

Unlike checks, you can review remediations in the guide--there is a clickable `(show)` link to do so.
Bring back the browser window with the guide open, and see for yourself.

image::0-03-remediation.png[]

. Now you improve the remediation script by adding a comment stating that the numerical value is "number of seconds."
Edit the remediation file:
+
----
[... accounts_tmout]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab1_introduction
[... lab1_introduction]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/bash/shared.sh
----
+
You can see that there are some extra lines, but the script corresponds to the content displayed in the HTML guide.
. The `populate var_accounts_tmout` line is the one that gets transformed into the variable assignment statement.
Put the explanatory comment just above it:
+
----
# platform = Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7,Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8,multi_platform_fedora,multi_platform_ol
. /usr/share/scap-security-guide/remediation_functions
# The timeout delay is defined by number of seconds
populate var_accounts_tmout

if grep --silent ^TMOUT /etc/profile ; then
        sed -i "s/^TMOUT.*/TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout/g" /etc/profile
else
        echo -e "\n# Set TMOUT to $var_accounts_tmout per security requirements" >> /etc/profile
        echo "TMOUT=$var_accounts_tmout" >> /etc/profile
fi
----

. After you are done,
press `Ctrl+X`, then enter `y` to save and exit.

. Rebuild the guide:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ ./build_product rhel8
----

. Once the build is done, refresh the guide. Expect the remediation to contain the newly added comment.

Congratulations, by completing the lab exercise, you became familiar with a comprehensive content creation tool and one of the largest open source repositories available.
