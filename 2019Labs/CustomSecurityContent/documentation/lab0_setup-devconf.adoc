= Lab Exercise 0: Setup Steps


== 0.1 Accessing Your Dedicated Lab Environment Using Your Provided GUID

. From your laptop, navigate to the https://www.opentlc.com/gg/gg.cgi?profile=generic_matyc[*Lab GUID Assignment page*^]. Firefox with plugins disabled recommended.
From this page, you will be assigned your unique GUID, which you will use to access your unique lab environment and systems.


. Select the proper *Lab Code* from the drop-down list. Find the `Lab1 - Creating customized security policy content to automate security compliance` lab.
The activation key is *security*.

. The resulting *Lab Information page* displays your GUID and other useful information about your lab environment.
Take note of your assigned GUID.
You will use this GUID to access your lab's environment and systems.
Your GUID is also embedded in your lab environment's host names.
From the *Lab Information page*, you can also access your unique lab environment's power control and consoles.
Go to the last bullet and click `here` to access the environment's power control and consoles.

. Note that one workstation VM is shown on the *power control and consoles page*.
This is a Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ 8 system with GUI. It is the machine that you will use throughout all of the exercises in this lab.
Click `CONSOLE`.
Log in as *Lab User* with the password *r3dh4t1!*.

Congratulations, you are in your *graphical console*.


== 0.2 Using the Text Console to Access the Remote Shell

. On your laptop (_not_ in the browser window with the remote desktop), open the `Terminal` application.
Then, enter the following command, replacing `GUID` with your assigned GUID. Type *r3dh4t1!* for the password.
+
----
[... ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----
+
For example, if your GUID is `3fa1`, you execute `$ ssh lab-user@workstation-3fa1.rhpds.opentlc.com`.

. If everything works correctly, you end up in the lab's system shell.
You can confirm this by listing the directory with lab exercises:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd
[... ~]$ ls labs
lab1_introduction  lab2_openscap  lab3_profiles  lab4_ansible  lab5_oval
----

Congratulations, now you are in your *text console*.

== 0.3 Lab-Related Tips

This section contains various tips that may be useful to keep in mind as you are doing the lab exercises.


=== 0.3.1 Command Listings

Shell session listings obey the following conventions:

----
[... ~]$ pwd
/home/lab-user
[... ~]$ cd labs
[... labs]$ ls
lab1_introduction  lab2_openscap  lab3_profiles  lab4_ansible  lab5_oval
[... labs]$ cat /etc/passwd
...
lab-user:x:1000:1000:Lab User:/home/lab-user:/bin/bash
----

- Commands such as `pwd` and `cat /etc/passwd` in this example are prefixed by `[...`, followed by the respective directory name and `]$`.
For reference, in the actual terminal, commands are prefixed also by the current username and hostname--for example, `[lab-user@workstation-3fa1 ~]$`.
- Lines that follow commands and are not commands themselves represent the last command's output.
In the example above, the output of the `ls` command in the `labs` directory is a list of directories with lab exercises.
- Ellipses may be used to indicate multiple output lines that have been omitted because they are of no interest.
In the example above, the output of the `cat /etc/passwd` command contains many lines with the line containing lab-user's entry emphasized by an ellipsis.


=== 0.3.2 Copy and Paste Conventions

Normally, when you select text you want to copy in the document, you press `Ctrl+C` to copy it to the system clipboard, and you paste it from the clipboard to the editor using `Ctrl+V`.

Keep in mind that when you paste to the **terminal console** or **terminal editor**, you have to use `Ctrl+Shift+V` instead of `Ctrl+V`.
The same applies when copying from the Terminal window--you have to use `Ctrl+Shift+C` after selecting the text, not just `Ctrl+C`.


=== 0.3.3 Browser Searches

When you search for an occurrence of text in the Firefox browser, you have the following options:

- Pressing `Ctrl+F`, which brings up the search window.
- Clicking the "hamburger menu" at the top right corner, and clicking the `Find in This Page` entry.
This is the same as the previous option, but it is useful if you have problems with the keyboard shortcut.
+

- If the browser has the link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/find-in-page-with-preview/[Find in Page^] extension installed, there is a blue icon close to the "hamburger menu" at the top right corner of the browser.
You can click it and start typing the text to search for.
The extension displays previews of the web page next to occurrences of the expression.

== 0.4 Setting up the Lab Environment using Fedora Virtual Machine

NOTE: If you use the provided lab environment you can skip this entire section and go to: link:lab1_introduction.adoc[Lab exercise 1: Say Hello to ComplianceAsCode]

This section contains instructions on how to setup a Fedora environment for the lab.

=== 0.4.1 Creating a Fedora Virtual Machine

. Download latest available version of Fedora ISO image here: https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/

. Install it using your favorite Virtual Machine software (e.g. `KVM`, `VirtualBox`, `VMWare`, etc...)

. After you complete the installation and everything is set up, start the `SSH` server on the Virtual Machine. Open a terminal on the Virtual Machine and type:
+
----
[... ~]$ sudo service sshd start
----
+
. Go to `Settings->Network` and write down the IPv4 address of this Virtual Machine so we can run Ansible^(R)^ playbooks to setup the lab environment and also to access the terminal through `SSH`. The following image illustrates how to find the IPv4 address:

image:0-06-ipaddress.png[600,600]

=== 0.4.2 Setting up the Lab environment

. Now on your host machine, clone this repository to access the lab setup playbooks (`git` package needs to be installed):
+
----
[... ~]$ git clone https://github.com/RedHatDemos/SecurityDemos.git
----
+

. Switch to the right directory:
+
----
[... ~]$ cd SecurityDemos/2019Labs/CustomSecurityContent/setup
----
+

. Now it is time to run the Ansible^(R)^ playbooks. But first make sure that you have Ansible^(R)^ installed on your machine, follow the instructions here first if you don't have: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

+
----
[... setup]$ ansible-playbook -i <VM_IPv4_ADDRESS>, system_setup.yml labs_setup.yml -k -K -u <VM_USER>
----
+

NOTE: Replace `<VM_IPv4_ADDRESS>` with the Virtual Machine's IPv4 address and `<VM_USER>` with the user you created in your Virtual Machine. Pay attention at the required `comma` after the IPv4 address parameter. You will be prompted to input the password of `<VM_USER>` twice, the second time you can press `Enter` so it uses the first password as input.

. After the `ansible-playbook` command finishes, you are now able to start the lab. First login to the user `lab-user` (the setup playbooks have created it) on you Virtual Machine using the password *r3dh4t1!*. And for convenience you can run all the commands through a `SSH` terminal, run the following command:

+
----
[... setup]$ ssh lab-user@<VM_IPv4_ADDRESS>
----
+

Use password:

----
...password: r3dh4t1!
----

=== Important thing to keep in mind (Fedora only)

. This lab was primarily created to work on Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ machines, but it is totally compatible with Fedora. So whenever you see `rhel8` or `rhel7` in commands that need to be run you switch to `fedora`. For example:
+
----
[... ~]$ ./build_product rhel8
----
+

But instead you execute:
+
----
[... ~]$ ./build_product fedora
----
+
