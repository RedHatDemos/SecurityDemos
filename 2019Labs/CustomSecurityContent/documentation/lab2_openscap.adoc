== 2.1 Introduction

As you already know from link:lab1_introduction.adoc[Lab Exercise 1^], the `ComplianceAsCode` project provides security content that can be used for automated security scanning of your system.

Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ 8 (RHEL 8) contains OpenSCAP Scanner, which is a security scanner that works with `ComplianceAsCode` content.
The content that you build in `ComplianceAsCode` can be simply passed to OpenSCAP Scanner and the scan can be started right away.

OpenSCAP Scanner allows you to perform security compliance checks in a fully automated way.
It is possible to run the scan using either the `oscap` command line tool or the SCAP Workbench graphical application.
Several integrations for continuous scanning also exist, but in this lab exercise, you focus on one-off scanning.

.*Goals*

* Learn the basics of automated security scanning in Red Hat^(R)^ Enterprise Linux^(R)^ 8
* Learn how to use `ComplianceAsCode` for automated security scanning
* Learn how to do lightweight customization of a predefined security policy using a GUI tool
* Explore the possibilities for remediations of failing rules


.*Preconfigured Lab Environment*

* The `ComplianceAsCode` repository was cloned to the `lab2_openscap` directory.
* The dependencies required for the `ComplianceAsCode` content build were installed using `yum install`:
** Generic build utilities: `cmake` and `make`
** Utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-scanner`
** Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml` and `python3-jinja2`
* The following OpenSCAP ecosystem packages were installed using `yum install`:
** The scanner: `openscap-scanner`
** Utilities for scanning remote systems: `openscap-utils`
** The GUI front end and datastream tool: `scap-workbench`


== 2.2 Introduction to OpenSCAP Command Line Tool

OpenSCAP provides a command line tool called `oscap` that can be used for automated security scanning.

. You can verify a successful installation of `oscap` by running the following commands:
+
----
[... lab1_introduction]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap
[... lab2_openscap]$ oscap --version

OpenSCAP command line tool (oscap) 1.3.1
Copyright 2009--2018 Red Hat Inc., Durham, North Carolina.

==== Supported specifications ====
XCCDF Version: 1.2
OVAL Version: 5.11.1

...
----
+
Note that this command outputs the OpenSCAP version and versions of supported standards.

== 2.3 Using `ComplianceAsCode` Content with OpenSCAP Command Line Tool

In this section, you build the security content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 from `ComplianceAsCode` source code and then you use the built content with the OpenSCAP command line tool to scan your machine.

. The content has been built, so you can take a look at the generated files in the `build` directory right away:
+
----
[... lab2_openscap]$ cd build
[... build]$ ls
...
ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
ssg-rhel8-ocil.xml
ssg-rhel8-oval.xml
...
----
+
There are multiple files produced by the build. The file that is going to be used with the OpenSCAP scanner is `ssg-rhel8-ds.xml`. This file is called a SCAP Datastream.
+
. Check which compliance profiles are available for RHEL 8.
+
----
[... build]$ oscap info ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
...
    Profiles:
        Title: Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Security Policy
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cjis
        Title: Unclassified Information in Non-federal Information Systems and Organizations (NIST 800-171)
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_cui
        Title: Red Hat Corporate Profile for Certified Cloud Providers (RH CCP)
            Id: xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp
...
----
+
In the "Profiles:" section, you can see a list of profiles contained in the datastream.
The datastream contains multiple profiles that cover different security baselines for different purposes.
Each profile is identified by a profile ID.
+
The built `ComplianceAsCode` content is available as a RHEL `scap-security-guide` RPM package.
Unlike the upstream repository that you work with now, the package contains only content that is officially tested and supported by Red Hat.
Therefore, the `scap-security-guide` package in RHEL 8 contains only the OSPP and PCI-DSS profiles at the moment.
+
. Perform your first baseline testing scan with the vanilla OSPP profile.
+
Note in the command below that you can skip the profile ID prefix to make the command simpler.
The real ID is `xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp`.
+
The scanning command has to be executed by a privileged user using `sudo`, so the scanner can access parts of the system that are off-limits to common users.
The simplest scanner invocation can look like this:
+
----
sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
+
However, you also want to store the scan results so you can process them later.
Therefore, you have to supply additional arguments:

* Use `--results-arf` to get a machine-readable results archive
* Use `--report` to get a human-readable report (this can also be generated from ARF after the scan, as you see in the next optional step)
* Use `--oval-results` to get detailed results in the report
+
Now execute the following to run the scan and generate the HTML report as a side-effect:
+
----
[... build]$ sudo oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/lab2_report.html --oval-results ./ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
...
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You can also generate the HTML report later by executing these commands:

----
[... build]$ sudo rm -f /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/lab2_report.html
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/arf.xml > /home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/lab2_report.html
----

====


. Open the file explorer by clicking `Activities` and then the "file cabinet" icon.
Once it opens, click the `Home` icon in the top left portion of the browser's window.
Click `labs` then `lab2_openscap` folders.
Expect to see the `lab2_report.html` file there. Double-click it to open it in the browser.
+
image:getting-report.png[]
+
You see the compliance scan results for every security control in the OSPP security baseline profile in HTML format.
+
image:lab1.1-scapreport.png[]
+
Rules can have several types of results, but the most common ones are *pass* and *fail*, which indicate whether a particular security control has passed or failed the scan.
Other results you frequently encounter are *notapplicable* for rules that have been skipped as not relevant to the scanned system, and *notchecked* for rules without an automated check.

. Click the rule title in the HTML report.
+
image:lab1.1-clickrule.png[]
+
This brings up a pop-up dialog that allows you to examine why a particular rule failed or passed.
For example, if a rule is testing file permissions on a list of files, it specifies which files failed and what their permission bits are.

== 2.4 Customizing Existing SCAP Security Content Using SCAP Workbench

. In the console view, click `Activities` in the top left corner of the screen, then select the green circle icon for SCAP Workbench.

. After Workbench starts, select `Other SCAP content` in the drop-down list and click `Load Content`. A file browser window appears.
. Locate `ssg-rhel8-ds.xml` from the `/home/lab-user/labs/lab2_openscap/build` directory and click `Open` to open the compliance content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 that you built in the previous section.
+
image:load_content.png[]
+
image::scap_workbench_opened.png[SCAP Workbench opened, profile selected]

. Customize the PCI-DSS Control baseline.
.. Select this profile from the `Profile` drop-down list.
.. Click `Customize`.
+
image:select_profile.png[]

.. In the `Customize Profile` pop-up window, leave the name generated by default for `New Profile ID` and click `OK`.
+
image:lab1.2-newprofileID.png[500,500]

.. Now you can select and deselect rules according to your organization's needs, and change values such as minimum password length, to tailor the compliance profile.
. After you are done customizing, click `OK` to save the profile.
You have now created a new custom profile.
+
image::scap_workbench_tailoring.png[SCAP Workbench content customization]

. Run a test scan with the new custom profile you just created.
.. Click `Scan` and inspect the results.
.. When prompted for the password for Lab User, type *r3dh4t1!*.
This takes a few minutes, so feel free to move on with the lab exercise and not wait for the scan to complete.
+
image:lab1.2-scapworkbenchscan.png[500,500]
.. Close the *Diagnostics* window.
+
[TIP]
====
You can save the customization to a tailoring file by selecting `File->Save Customization Only`.

== 2.5 Security Remediations with OpenSCAP, Red Hat Ansible Automation, and Bash
Putting the machine into compliance (for example, by changing its configuration) is called *remediation* in the SCAP terminology.
Remediation changes the configuration of the machine, and it is possible to lock yourself out or disable important workloads!
As a result, it is a best practice to test the remediation changes before deploying.

You use Terminal on your laptop for the next part--there is no need to use the console.

. Generate an Ansible^(R)^ Playbook that puts your machine into compliance.
.. Generate a playbook from the scan results.
Use the `--fix-type ansible` option to request an Ansible Playbook with the fixes:
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > playbook.yml
----
+
You specified the empty `result-id` because `oscap` supports generation of fixes from a result file that has results from multiple scans. However, as there is only one result from a single scan, you do not have to specify the result ID explicitly.

. Check the output using a text editor:
+
----
[... build]$ nano playbook.yml
----

. When finished, exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl+X`.
. Generate a Bash remediation script from the scan results.
..Run the following command, using `--fix-type bash` to request a bash script with the fixes:
+
----
[... build]$ oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > bash-fix.sh
----
+
You specified the empty `result-id` because `oscap` supports generation of fixes from a result file that has results from multiple scans. However, as there is only one result from a single scan, you do not have to specify the result ID explicitly.

. Check the output using a text editor:
+
----
[... build]$ nano bash-fix.sh
----

. When finished, exit `nano` by pressing `Ctrl+X`.


The Ansible Playbook can be used to configure a system to meet a compliant state. Using Ansible Playbooks is discussed in link:lab4_ansible.adoc[Lab Exercise 4^].
The Bash remediation script also can be used to change the configuration of the system.
It is recommended that you review the contents of these scripts and test them in a testing environment first, as they have the potential to make unexpected or harmful changes.
