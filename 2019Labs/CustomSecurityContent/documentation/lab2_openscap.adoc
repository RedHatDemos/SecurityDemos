= OpenSCAP Basics and Command Line Scanning

:experimental:
:imagesdir: ../../RHELSecurityLab/documentation/images


== What will you learn

* ... basics of automated security scanning in the OpenSCAP ecosystem.
* ... how to do lightweight customization of a predefined security policy using a GUI tool.
* ... how to scan a system against a security policy.
* ... what possibilities do you have for remediations of failing rules.


== What have we done for you

* We have installed the OpenSCAP ecosystem packages, using `dnf install`:
** The scanner: `openscap-scanner`,
** utilities for scanning remote systems `openscap-utils`,
** GUI frontend and datastream tool `scap-workbench`, and finally
** the content `scap-security-guide`.
* Finally, we have installed the `ansible` package.


== Introduction

OpenSCAP is a family of open source SCAP tools and content that help users create standard security checklists for enterprise systems.
Natively shipping in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenSCAP provides practical security hardening advice for Red Hat technologies and links to compliance requirements, making deployment activities like certifications and accreditations easier.

OpenSCAP allows you to perform both vulnerability and security compliance checks in a fully automated way.
Several integrations for continuous scanning exist but in this lab exercise, we will focus on one-off scanning to get started.


== Pre-Configured Set Up Steps (Already done for you)

All of the steps in this pre-configured set up section have already been done for you.
This section is for your reference only so you know what steps have already been pre-configured in this lab environment for you.

You can verify a successful installation by running:

----
oscap -V

OpenSCAP command line tool (oscap) 1.3.0
Copyright 2009--2018 Red Hat Inc., Durham, North Carolina.

==== Supported specifications ====
XCCDF Version: 1.2
OVAL Version: 5.11.1
CPE Version: 2.3
CVSS Version: 2.0
CVE Version: 2.0
Asset Identification Version: 1.1
Asset Reporting Format Version: 1.1
CVRF Version: 1.1
...
----

Notice that this command outputs the OpenSCAP version and versions of supported standards.
If during your own installation it says `oscap` command not found, you need to install the OpenSCAP tooling since this means that OpenSCAP has not been installed successfully.


== Lab 1.1 Security scanning with OpenSCAP

. Let's take a look at the compliance content provided by `scap-security-guide`:
+
----
rpm -ql scap-security-guide
...
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-cpe-dictionary.xml
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-cpe-oval.xml
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-oval.xml
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-xccdf.xml
...
----

. Notice that the provided content in `scap-security-guide` covers a wide range of security baselines such as PCI-DSS, STIG, C2S, Common, CJIS, and others.
. Notice that content provided in `scap-security-guide` covers a wide range of security baselines.
For Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, OSPP (Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems) and PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) profiles are available.
There are also various formats in which this is provided - human readable HTML guides, SCAP benchmarks, but also Ansible remediation playbooks. 

. Move to the `content` folder so we can avoid typing long paths:
+
----
cd /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content
----

. First, let's check which compliance profiles are available for rhel7.
+
----
oscap info ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
+
You will get print out of contents - aforementioned two compliance profiles. OSPP - Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems, and PCI-DSS.

. Next, let's perform our first baseline testing scan with the vanilla OSPP profile.
Notice in our command below that we can skip the profile ID prefix to make the command simpler.
The real ID is xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp.
+
----
oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp ./ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
+
Now, you will see the compliance scan results for every security control in the OSPP security baseline profile.

. Now, let's store the results of the scan this time:
* use `--results-arf` to get machine readable results archive
* use `--report` to get human readable report (can also be generated from ARF after the scan as you see in the next optional step)

----
oscap xccdf eval --profile ospp --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /tmp/report.html ./ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----

. (Optional) You can also generate the HTML report separately:
+
----
oscap xccdf generate report /tmp/arf.xml > /tmp/report.html
----

. Open the file explorer and head to the `/tmp` directory.
The `report.html` file should be there - double click on it to open it in the Firefox browser.
You will see the compliance scan results for every security control in the OSPP security baseline profile in HTML format.
+
image:lab1.1-reportfromworkstation.png[300,300]
image:lab1.1-scapreport.png[500,500]

. Rules can have several types of results but the most common ones are *pass* and *fail*, which indicate whether or not the particular security control has passed or failed the scan.

. Click on the rule title in the HTML report.
+
image:lab1.1-clickrule.png[600,600]

. This will bring up a pop-up dialog that allows you to examine why a particular OpenSCAP security rule failed or passed.
For example, if an OpenSCAP security rule is testing file permissions on a list of files, it will specify which files failed and what are their permission bits.

== Customizing existing SCAP security content using SCAP workbench

. Click *Activities* at the top left part of the screen, and click the green-ish icon of `scap-workbench`.

. After Workbench starts, select *RHEL8* and click on *Load Content* to open the compliance content for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
+
image:lab1.2-scapsecurityguide.png[600,600]
+
image::scap_workbench_opened.png[SCAP Workbench opened, profile selected]

. Let's customize the PCI-DSS Control baseline.
Select this profile from the *Profile* drop-down list.
Click *Customize*.
+
image:lab1.2-selectcustomize.png[700,700]

. In the *Customize Profile* pop-up window, leave the default New Profile ID name and click *OK*.
+
image:lab1.2-newprofileID.png[500,500]

. Now you can select and unselect rules according to your organization's needs and change values such as minimum password length to tailor the compliance profile.
After you are done customizing click *OK* to save the profile.
You have now created a new custom profile.
+
image::scap_workbench_tailoring.png[SCAP Workbench content customization]

. Now let's run a test scan with the new custom profile we just created.
Click *Scan* and inspect the results.
When prompted for the password for *lab-user*, type *r3dh4t1!*.
This will take a few minutes so feel free to move on with the lab exercise and not wait until the scan is completed.
+
image:lab1.2-scapworkbenchscan.png[500,500]

. (Optional) You can save it to a tailoring file by selecting File->Save Customization Only.

== Lab 1.3 Security Remediations with OpenSCAP and Ansible
Putting the machine into compliance (for example by changing its configuration) is called *remediation* in the SCAP terminology.
Remediation changes the configuration of the machine and it is possible that you will lock yourself out or disable important workloads!
As a result, it is best practice to test the remediation changes before deploying.

. All remediations will be executed locally.

. Let's generate an Ansible playbook that will put the *openscap.example.com* machine into compliance.
Let's go ahead and generate a playbook from the results:
+
Use the `--fix-type ansible` option to request an ansible playbook with the fixes:
+
----
oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type ansible --result-id "" arf.xml > playbook.yml
----

. (Optional) Generate bash remediation script and run it on target machine(s). This can be accomplished by running:
* use `--fix-type bash` to request a bash script with the fixes
* after the script is generated change its permissions so that we can run it
+
----
oscap xccdf generate fix --fix-type bash --result-id "" arf.xml > bash-fix.sh
chmod +x bash-fix.sh
./bash-fix.sh
----

. Notice that in both cases we are using empty result-id.
This is a trick to avoid specifying the full result ID.

. We will focus on the Ansible remediation options in this next part of the lab exercise.

. Let's open the generated playbook using a text editor.
In this example, we will use `gedit` as our text editor (but feel free to use `vi` as well).
+
----
gedit playbook.yml
----
+
The file contents look like this:
+
....
---
###############################################################################
#
# Ansible remediation role for the results of evaluation of profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp-rhel7
# XCCDF Version:  1.2
#

#
# How to apply this remediation role:
# $ ansible-playbook -i "192.168.1.155," playbook.yml
# $ ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
#
###############################################################################
....

. Exploring the playbook further you will see the tasks that set up the machine:
+
....
   - name: Ensure gpgcheck Enabled For All Yum Package Repositories
      with_items: "{{ yum_find.files }}"
      lineinfile:
        create: yes
        dest: "{{ item.path }}"
        regexp: '^gpgcheck'
        line: 'gpgcheck=1'
      tags:
        - ensure_gpgcheck_never_disabled
        - high_severity
        - unknown_strategy
        - low_complexity
        - medium_disruption
        - CCE-26876-3
        - NIST-800-53-CM-5(3)
        - NIST-800-53-SI-7
        - NIST-800-53-MA-1(b)
        - NIST-800-171-3.4.8
        - PCI-DSS-Req-6.2
        - CJIS-5.10.4.1
....

. You can customize the playbook by changing the variables listed at the top of the generated file.
Let's change the password minimum length by setting the `var_password_pam_minlen` to `!!str 18`.
After making this change, save and exit the text editor.
+
....
   vars:
      var_accounts_password_minlen_login_defs: !!str 15
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_deny: !!str 3
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time: !!str never
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_fail_interval: !!str 900
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_deny: !!str 3
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_unlock_time: !!str never
      var_accounts_passwords_pam_faillock_fail_interval: !!str 900
      var_password_pam_minlen: !!str 12
      var_password_pam_ocredit: !!str -1
      var_password_pam_lcredit: !!str -1
      var_password_pam_ucredit: !!str -1
      var_password_pam_dcredit: !!str -1
      var_accounts_tmout: !!str 600
      var_system_crypto_policy: !!str FIPS
      rsyslog_remote_loghost_address: !!str logcollector
...
....

. Let's run the playbook locally in check mode to see how it would change the machine to put it into compliance.
Setting `ansible_python_interpreter` is workaround for known issue in Ansible 2.7 used on the machine.
+
----
ansible-playbook -i "localhost," -c local --check playbook.yml -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
