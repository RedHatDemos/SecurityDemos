= Cloud Provider plays


Here are the ansible code dealing with Cloud Provisioning. It is separated in two files for each Cloud provider:

* `{{cloud_provider}}_infrastructure_deployment.yml`
+
Provision the environment (instances, VPC, dns, etc) using a template from the config. Ex: for AWS, it's a Cloudformation template.
* `{{cloud_provider}}_ssh_config_setup.yml`
+
Generate SSH config file to access the environment.
