= Lab 11: Crypto Policies

*Lab Length: Short (~10 mins)*

== Goal of Lab
The goal of this lab is to use the new Crypto Policies tools to have a consistent security configuration across all cryptographic libraries in the system. The lab will also show how to configure the system so that it is FIPS compliant using the new simplified workflow in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

== Introduction
The idea behind System-wide Crypto Policies is to give Administrator a simple interface to change the security level of a system, so that all cryptographic libraries follow the same set of rules and enable or disable the same set of cryptographic primitives and protocols.

In the past each application required individual configuration changes to be performed on multiple different configuration files to have the system configured so that it consistently used the same cryptographic primitives across all programs. This process was difficult to maintain and operate.

With the introduction of crypto policies we have made it much simpler to set a default policy for all applications. The policy can still be overriden at the application level if exceptions are desired.

== Pre-Configured Items
The machines have been pre-configured to use a Root CA certificate and individual X509 certificates for the Servers used for testing. The Root CA certificate has been imported in the system trust store so all applications can trust the test certificates used by the servers in the exercise.

== Lab 11.1 Connecting to a Web Server using TLS 1.1
TLS 1.1 is disabled in RHEL 8 default security policy, so connecting to a TLS 1.1 server will result in an error by client tools.
In this exercise we will explore how to enable the system to connect to legacy systems that are limited to use only TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 protocols.
We will use two tools, `curl` and `wget`, as they use two different cryptographic libraries (openSSL and GnuTLS respectively), to show the crypto policy setting work across application and libraries.

== Lab 11.2 Connecting to a Web Server using a SHA-1 Certificate
SHA-1 Certificates are still enabled in RHEL 8 default security policy for compatibility reasons.
In this exercise we will explore how to change the system to the FUTURE policy which disables SHA-1 signatures.
We will use two tools, curl and wget, as they use two different cryptographic libraries (openSSL and GnuTLS respectively), to show the crypto policy setting work across application and libraries.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab’s GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*

[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Log into the *crypto.example.com* host as *root*.

[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ ssh root@crypto.example.com
----

. Try to connect to the web server https://crypto2-sha1.example.com:2443 and verify that the connection is accepted

== Lab 11.3 Switching the system into FIPS mode
When a system is configured to work in FIPS mode, only a restricted set of approved cryptographic algorithms is permitted.
In this exercise we will learn how to put a system into FIPS mode and we'll test that specific algorithms are disabled in this mode.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab’s GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Log into the *crypto.example.com* host as *root*.
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ ssh root@crypto.example.com
----

. Let's change the system configuration to run in FIPS mode.
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# fips-mode-setup --enable
Setting system policy to FIPS
Note: System-wide crypto policies are applied on application start-up.
It is recommended to restart the system for the change of policies
to fully take place.
FIPS mode will be enabled.
Please reboot the system for the setting to take effect.
----

. Now let's reboot the system to activate FIPS mode.
+
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# reboot
Connection to crypto.example.com closed by remote host.
Connection to crypto.example.com closed.
----

. Log again into the *crypto.example.com* host as *root* after reboot (retry multiple times if the command fails).
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ ssh root@crypto.example.com
----

. Let's check that the system is in FIPS mode.
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# fips-mode-setup --check
FIPS mode is enabled.
----

. Let's check that SHA-1 signed certificates are disabled in FIPS mode.
+
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# curl https://crypto2-sha1.example.com:2443
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: EE certificate key too weak

[root@crypto ~]# wget https://crypto2-sha1.example.com:2443
--2019-03-06 19:00:00--  https://crypto2-sha1.example.com:2443/
Resolving crypto2-sha1.example.com (crypto2-sha1.example.com)... 192.168.0.7
Connecting to crypto2-sha1.example.com (crypto2-sha1.example.com)|192.168.0.7|:2443... connected.
ERROR: The certificate of 'crypto2-sha1.example.com' is not trusted.
ERROR: The certificate of 'crypto2-sha1.example.com' was signed using an insecure algorithm.
----

. Let's also check that unapproved Elliptic Curves are not accepted.
+
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# wget https://crypto2-ed25519.example.com:3443
--2019-03-06 19:35:20--  https://crypto2-ed25519.example.com:3443/
Resolving crypto2-ed25519.example.com (crypto2-ed25519.example.com)... 192.168.0.7
Connecting to crypto2-ed25519.example.com (crypto2-ed25519.example.com)|192.168.0.7|:3443... connected.
GnuTLS: A TLS fatal alert has been received.
GnuTLS: received alert [40]: Handshake failed
Unable to establish SSL connection.
----

. Now let's disable FIPS and return the system to the default policy
+
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# fips-mode-setup --disable
Setting system policy to DEFAULT
Note: System-wide crypto policies are applied on application start-up.
It is recommended to restart the system for the change of policies
to fully take place.
FIPS mode will be disabled.
Please reboot the system for the setting to take effect.
----

. Let's check that certificates using Ed25519 are accepted again.
+
[source]
----
[root@crypto ~]# wget -q -O - https://crypto2-ed25519.example.com:3443
WORKS!
----
NOTE: This step works even without a reboot because the wget is a command line binary and not a long term running process. Reboot is recommended to make sure all resident services are restarted and re-read their configuration (including the libraries they instantiate).
