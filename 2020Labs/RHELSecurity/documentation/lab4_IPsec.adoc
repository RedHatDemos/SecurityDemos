= Lab 4: Cloud encryption using RHEL Opportunistic IPsec

*Lab Length: Medium/Average (~15 mins)*

== Goal of Lab
In this lab exercise, you will learn how to deploy Opportunistic
IPsec to encrypt all host to host communication within an enterprise
network. Whenever two hosts in the network want to send any kind of
traffic, IPsec security will automatically activate and encrypt all
traffic between those hosts. This is also called mesh encryption.

In this lab exercise, you will learn:

* How to generate X.509 certificates using a python helper script
* Configure Opportunistic IPsec on two or more nodes
* How to debug and monitor the network for IPsec encryption

== Introduction

Imagine a LAN of various machines. Each machine is given an X.509
certificate in the form of a PKCS#12 file (eg ipsecXXX.example.com). This
file contains the Certificate Agency of Example Org and the node's own
certificate and private key.  Machines in the network should automatically
initiate IPsec encryption and authenticate each other based on these
certificates whenever any traffic is attempted between these nodes. We
call this Opportunistic IPsec.

There are two machines available to you for this specific lab
exercise. But as this configuration method's main feature is scalability,
you can pick up another X.509 certificate and repeat the process for any
other provided lab VM. However, do be careful.  If you misconfigure IPsec
and do not allow fallback to cleartext, you can lock yourself out of a VM.

== Lab 4.1 Create and Install X.509 certificates

We will need to generate the required X.509 certificates. To make this
easier, on ipsec.example.com, there is a script (/root/vpn-cert-gen.py)
that generates x.509 certificates for ipsec.example.com and
ipsec2.example.com for use with this exercise.  It also creates certificates
for audit.example.com and usbguard.example.com if you want to try and add
more machines to the encrypted mesh network. All our actions are run as root.

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Log into the *ipsec.example.com* host as *root*.
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ ssh root@ipsec.example.com
----
. In order to create the X.509 certificates for the lab, run the following
commands:

	[root@ipsec ~]# mkdir /root/labcerts

	[root@ipsec ~]# cd /root/labcerts

	[root@ipsec labcerts]# /root/vpn-cert-gen.py --wipe
	creating CA cert
	OK: CA system completely re-initialized

	[root@ipsec labcerts]# ls
	cacerts  certs  keys  mobileconfig  pkcs12  serial.txt

	[root@ipsec labcerts]# ls pkcs12/
	audit.example.com.p12  ipsec2.example.com.p12  ipsec.example.com.p12  servera.example.com.p12  usbguard.example.com.p12

+
NOTE:

* The cacerts/ directory contains the Certificate Agency (CA) certificate.
* The certs/ directory contains the regular node certificates
* The keys/ directory contains the private keys. But the script has already combined these for you into PKCS#12 based certificates in the pkcs12/ directory.
* The mobileconfig/ directory has Apple device profiles that include the PKCS#12 certificate and all other configuration items that are needed for those devices, but these files are only useful when building a Remote Access VPN server. We will not use them for
this mesh host-to-host encryption using Opportunistic IPsec.

* Just pick the proper pkcs12/*.p12 files for each of the hosts you want to add to the crypto mesh.

* Note that due to one security issue, the certificates must have a SubjectAltName specifying the IP address they are using (to prevent one machine from impersonating another). Since we do not have full reverse DNS and DNSSEC in this lab, libreswan cannot link the IP address to the hostname securely.  This is why the python script hardcodes the IP address in the SubjectAltName of the X.509
certificate.

== Lab 4.2 Configure Opportunistic IPsec

. In order to setup ipsec.example.com, first install libreswan and initialize the
certificate database using the following commands:

	[root@ipsec ~]# yum install libreswan
	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec initnss

. Once libreswan is installed, you can import the PKCS#12 certificate:

	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec import /root/labcerts/pkcs12/ipsec.example.com.p12
	Enter password for PKCS12 file:
	pk12util: PKCS12 IMPORT SUCCESSFUL
	correcting trust bits for Certificate Agency (CA) - Test Org

. When prompted for the import password, type *secret*.

. You can confirm the node's certificate and CA certificate are installed and
available to libreswan:
+
[source]
....
[root@ipsec ~]# certutil -L -d sql:/etc/ipsec.d

Certificate Nickname                                         Trust Attributes
                                                             SSL,S/MIME,JAR/XPI

mycert                                                       u,u,u
Certificate Agency (CA) - Test Org                           CT,,
....

. Now our two hosts *ipsec.example.com* and *ipsec2.example.com* need to be configured
for IPsec. For these two hosts, we have pre-created the configuration file for
you and placed it on the machine at /root/oe-cert.conf . Copy this file into the
/etc/ipsec.d/ directory so libreswan can use it:

	[root@ipsec ~]# cp /root/oe-cert.conf /etc/ipsec.d/

+
NOTE: If you look at the file /root/oe-cert.conf, you will see it defines a number of
connections.  These connections are the different groups that we can assign
to network IP ranges. The conn "private" means that IPsec is mandatory and all
plaintext will be dropped. The conn "private-or-clear" means that IPsec is
attempted, but it will fallback to cleartext if it fails. The conn
"clear-or-private" means it will not initiate IPsec but it will respond to a
request for IPsec. The conn "clear" will never allow or initiate IPsec.

. If you are running with SElinux enabled, ensure all the files are properly
labeled:

	[root@ipsec ~]# restorecon -Rv /etc/ipsec.*

. To add an IP address (eg 192.168.0.66) or network range (eg
192.168.0.0/24) into one of these groups, simply add one line with the
IP address or network (in CIDR notation) into one of the files matching
the connection name in /etc/ipsec.d/policies. We will configure the machines
to attempt Opportunistic IPsec for the entire 192.168.0.0/24 range by adding
that network range to the "private-or-clear" group:

	[root@ipsec ~]# echo "192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear

. To ensure you will always be able to login to all machines via the workstation,
we will add a more specific entry into the "clear" group so Workstation
communication always happen unencrypted and we can always use it to login to
other machines to reconfigure or debug:

	[root@ipsec ~]# echo "192.168.0.3/32" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear

. And finally, we need to tell the firewalld system service that we want to open the firewall
for the required packets for IPsec:

	[root@ipsec ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=ipsec --permanent

	[root@ipsec ~]# firewall-cmd --reload

== Lab 4.3 Transfer the Configuration to a Second System

. Now we will configure the next machine, ipsec2.example.com. Since the
ipsec.example.com host contains all the certificates, we need to copy the
certificate onto ipsec2.example.com via the workstation VM:

. If not already there, log into to the workstation bastion host as *lab-user* from your desktop system *replacing GUID with your lab's GUID*. Use the password *r3dh4t1!*
+
[source]
----
[localhost ~]$ ssh lab-user@workstation-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

	[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ scp root@ipsec.example.com:/root/labcerts/pkcs12/ipsec2.example.com.p12 .

	[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ scp root@ipsec.example.com:/root/oe-cert.conf .

	[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ scp ipsec2.example.com.p12 oe-cert.conf root@ipsec2.example.com:/root/

. Then we install libreswan, import the certificate on ipsec2.example.com, and configure it for Opportunistc IPsec:

. Log into the *ipsec2.example.com* host as *root*.
+
[source]
----
[lab-user@workstation-GUID ~]$ ssh root@ipsec2.example.com
----
+
[source]
----
[root@ipsec2 ~]# yum install libreswan

[root@ipsec2 ~]# ipsec initnss

[root@ipsec2 ~]# ipsec import /root/ipsec2.example.com.p12
(Note: The password for PKCS12 file is secret)

[root@ipsec2 ~]# rm /root/ipsec2.example.com.p12

[root@ipsec2 ~]# mv /root/oe-cert.conf /etc/ipsec.d/

[root@ipsec2 ~]# restorecon -Rv /etc/ipsec.d

[root@ipsec2 ~]# echo "192.168.0.0/24" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear

[root@ipsec2 ~]# echo "192.168.0.3/32" >> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear

[root@ipsec2 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-service=ipsec --permanent

[root@ipsec2 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
----

Now you have configured the first two nodes. For each additional node, all you
need to do is generate and install a new certificate, add the same configuration
file with updated leftcert= entry and update the policy groups in
/etc/ipsec.d/policies/ to match the first two nodes of the cluster. So for each
added node, you do not need to reconfigure any of the previous nodes, as those
are already configured to trust the same CA and talk IPsec to the same IP ranges
as the new nodes. In a production setting, you should be able to populate new nodes
using ansible as all configuration files (other then the PKCS#12 certificate) are
identical on all the nodes.

== Lab 4.4 Using Opportunistic IPsec

. Now we are ready for testing our configuration. Start the IPsec subsystem on BOTH *ipsec* and *ipsec2*:

	[root@ipsec ~]# systemctl start ipsec

. And on the other host:

	[root@ipsec2 ~]# systemctl start ipsec

. Once you have done this on both machines, wait for a few seconds for both machines to
load their IPsec policues. Then a simple ping from ipsec.example.com
to ipsec2.example.com (or visa versa) should trigger an IPsec tunnel. The first
ping might or might not fail depending on the time it takes to setup the IPsec
connection.

. On *ipsec.example.com* type:

	[root@ipsec ~]# ping -c3 ipsec2.example.com

. You can check the system logs in /var/log/secure, or you can use one of the
various status commands available:

	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec trafficstatus
	006 #2: "private-or-clear#192.168.0.0/24"[1] ...192.168.0.22, type=ESP, add_time=1523268130, inBytes=1848, outBytes=1848, id='C=CA, ST=Ontario, L=Toronto, O=Test Org, OU=Clients, CN=ipsec.example.com, E=pwouters@redhat.com'

. You can see the non-zero byte counters for IPsec packets that shows the kernel
IPsec subsystem has encrypted and decrypted the network packets. A more verbose
command is:

	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec status
	<lots of output>

That's it! You have your two node IPsec encrypted mesh network running.

== Lab 4.5 Troubleshooting (Optional)

. If you think something went wrong and the ipsec status command does not show you
the connections private, private-or-clear and clear-or-private (and their
instances) then issue a manual command to see why loading failed:

	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec auto --add private

. If there is some kind of failure (eg the group is "private" but the remote end
is not functional), there will be no IPsec tunnel visible, but you should be
able to see the "shunts" that prevent or allow unencrypted traffic on the
network.

	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec whack --shuntstatus
	000 Bare Shunt list:
	000
	000 192.168.0.23/32:0 -0-> 192.168.0.22/32:0 => %drop 0    oe-failing

. There are a few different types of shunt. The negotiationshunt determines what
to do with packets while the IPsec connection is being established. Usually
people want to hold the packets to prevents leaks, but if encryption is only
"nice to have" and an uninterrupted service is more important, you can set this
option to "passthrough". The failureshunt option determines what to do when
negotiation fails. For the "private-or-clear" entry in your configuration file,
you can see it is set to "passthrough", allowing unencrypted traffic. For the
"private" entry you can see it is set to "drop" to disallow unencrypted traffic.

. You can use tcpdump to confirm that the connection is encrypted. Run a ping on
one host, and run tcpdump on the other host:

	[root@ipsec ~]# tcpdump -i ens3 -n esp
	tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
	listening on ens3, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
	05:58:18.003410 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x6), length 120
	05:58:18.003684 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x6), length 120
	05:58:19.004840 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x7), length 120
	05:58:19.005096 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x7), length 120
	05:58:20.006529 IP 192.168.0.22 > 192.168.0.23: ESP(spi=0x84019944,seq=0x8), length 120
	05:58:20.006730 IP 192.168.0.23 > 192.168.0.22: ESP(spi=0x5b312cc5,seq=0x8), length 120

. If you see ESP packets with tcpdump, it means the connection is sending
encrypted traffic. If you use ping and see ICMP packets, then the connection is
not encrypted. Due due to how the kernel hooks for IPsec and tcpdump interacts,
if you look at all traffic over an interface, you might see unencrypted packets
going out and encrypted (proto ESP) and decrypted packets coming in. This
happens because packets are encrypted by IPsec after the tcpdump hook has seen
the packet on some kernel version. The easiest indicator of whether traffic is
encrypted is to use the above mentioned trafficstatus command.

. Simply repeat this process on any new node to create your crypto mesh. If you
have added the entire network range (192.168.0.0/24) to the private or
private-or-clear groups, then for every new node you add, you do not need to
reconfigure anything on the existing node.

. You can also redo the test and not run libreswan on one node and do a ping. You
should see a few packets stalled or failing (based on whether the IP or subnet
appears in /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private or
/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear) before it fails to clear or installs a
block.

. If you run into more problems or you want to see in great detail what is
happening, you can enable two lines in /etc/ipsec.conf to get all logs in a file
and with full debugging. It is important to use file logging with full debugging
because otherwise the rsyslog or systemd ratelimit will kick in and you will
miss messages.

. If everything works as expected, you would now be ready to enable the IPsec
services on your cluster on every startup. So on each node run:

	[root@ipsec ~]# systemctl enable ipsec

== Resetting the IPsec NSS Certificate Database (Optional)

Libreswan uses the NDD cryptographic library. It keeps all its X.509
certificates and keys in its own NSS database in /etc/ipsec.d. If for some
reason you want restart the entire lab from scratch, then you want to remove the
entire libreswan NSS database, run the following commands:

CAUTION: running these commands will require you to restart the IPsec lab from
the beginning

	[root@ipsec ~]# systemctl stop ipsec
	[root@ipsec ~]# rm /etc/ipsec.d/*.db
	[root@ipsec ~]# ipsec initnss
	Initializing NSS database

Follow the same procedure for ipsec2.
