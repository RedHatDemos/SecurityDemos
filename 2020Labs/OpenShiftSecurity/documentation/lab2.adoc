== Lab 7: Implementing DevSecOps to Build and Automate Security into the Application in a Secure CI/CD Pipeline

*Lab Length: Medium/Average*

=== Goal of Lab 7

The goal of this lab is to learn how to automate and build security into the application and build a _secure software factory_ that orchestrates a combination of security tools including SonarQube, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), Red Hat Quay, Clair and the Open Security Content Automation Protocol (OpenSCAP) in a Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline (via Jenkins). We will also automatically detect security and compliance issues in a controlled way for automated security compliance at scale.


=== Introduction

The benefits of DevOps and Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) have been demonstrated with great success over the years. Security was initially treated as a second class citizen in many cases - left until the end usually to much detriment. With the advent of DevSecOps, security is put front and center - it is addressed in terms of people, processes and technology. Security tools are integrated right into the build process and you could easily break the build if security requirements are not met with the security gates that you build into your CI/CD pipeline.

This lab exercise will focus on some of the technologies used to implement automated security compliance controls within a typical CI/CD application pipeline.


A number of tools have been installed and pre-configured to support the DevSecOps pipeline. Most of these tools are running containerized within the Red Hat OpenShift cluster. Here is the pipeline we will be stepping through during our lab:

The Ansible role that deploys this entire pipeline can be found link:https://github.com/redhat-cop/agnosticd/tree/development/ansible/roles/ocp4-workload-security-compliance-lab[here].
This pipeline will checkout java web application source code from a git repository, build it, run automated tests, perform a static code analysis scan with SonarQube, send the produced artifact to Sonatype Nexus for storage, build a docker image containing our application, push it to quay for additional security scanning, perform OpenSCAP scans, deploy the application to OpenShift so that it can be scanned for web vulnerabilities by OWASP ZAP, then we have the opportunity to promote the application to other OpenShift projects if we are satisfied with the results. The following sections describe the tools we will be using in this pipeline lab.


==== Gogs
Gogs is the Go Git Service- a github-like git server written in the Go programming language.

_The goal of the Gogs open source project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service. With Go, this can be done with an independent binary distribution across ALL platforms that Go supports, including Linux, Mac OS X, Windows and ARM._

Gogs is great ligtweight git server for use in lab environments such as this. Most enterprise projects will use more fully-featured git repositories such as GitHub Enterprise, Gitlab, Atlassian BitBucket, etc.

==== Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration software tool written in the Java programming language for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time. The software enables developers to find and solve defects in a code base rapidly and to automate testing of their builds.

While there are other tools available for implementing CI/CD pipelines, jenkins is the most widely used. A containerized version is provided with OpenShift and integrates natively with it.

==== Apache Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.

Maven provides an opinionated framework defining a structure and layout for Java source code. By following this structure, a myriad of plugins can be used to simplify the build, documentation, testing and deployment of source code. The pipeline in this lab uses maven to build and package our source code as well as transmit the application to nexus (described below) and submit static code analysis requests to SonarQube (also described below).

==== Nexus
Sonatype Nexus is a repository manager. It allows you to proxy, collect, and manage your dependencies so that you are not constantly juggling a collection of Java ARchives (JARs). It makes it easy to distribute your software. Internally, you configure your build to publish artifacts to Nexus and they then become available to other developers.

When we build our application as a part of the lab, the resulting JAR file will be stored within nexus.

==== SonarQube
SonarQube is a static code analysis system that provides continuous inspection including the detection of common code issues, including in the areas of security.

In this lab we will upload the source code to SonarQube, which will perform static code analysis and produce various metrics, such as unit test code coverage.

==== Quay / Clair
Red Hat Quay is a private container registry that stores, builds, and deploys container images. It analyzes your images for security vulnerabilities (using Clair), identifying potential issues that can help you mitigate security risks. The pipeline will send our application image to quay where it will be automatically scanned for security vulnerabilities by Clair.

==== OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)
_The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is one of the worldâ€™s most popular free security tools and is actively maintained by hundreds of international volunteers. It can help you automatically find security vulnerabilities in your web applications while you are developing and testing your applications. Its also a great tool for experienced pentesters to use for manual security testing._

In our pipeline, we will stand up an instance of our web application then point OWASP ZAP to that instance so that it can perform a baseline security scan.

=== Sample application used in this lab exercise

For the purposes of this lab, we will be examining a simple, all-in-one https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[spring boot] application. The application presents a simple e-commerce web user interface, which is backed by a self-contained restful API.

=== Lab 7.3 Explore the pipeline stages


The following sections describe each of the stages in the CI/CD pipeline that we will be running during this lab.


==== Checkout
This stage checks the source code out the gogs git repository. Once the code is checked out, we can proceed with the rest of the pipeline.

==== Build
This stage uses Apache Maven to build our spring boot Java application from source. If the build fails, our pipeline will terminate since we cannot proceed with the remaining steps

==== Run tests
This stage again uses Maven to run any unit tests that were written. Unit tests are important in that they prevent our code from becoming brittle.  Without unit tests we can not be confident that any changes made to the source code will not adversely affect other parts of the code. By running unit tests we can also collect metrics in terms of what percentage of the code is being exercised by the tests. This is called code coverage and will be visible within SonarQube.

==== SonarQube Scan
During this stage we run the Maven SonarQube plugin to send the code, unit test results and code coverage metrics to our sonarqube server for static code analysis.

==== Archive to Nexus
The result of our build is the creation of a Java ARchive, or JAR file. This file is the Java bytecode that is run to deploy our web application. We send the JAR file to nexus for storage so that it can be retrieved in the future if needed (rather than having to rebuild the same version of code). This also allows our artifacts to be shared easily to other interested parties. The supported version of SonaType Nexus also has the ability to analyze any dependencies (libraries) used by our uploaded code to detect potential known vulnerabilities they may introduce.

==== Build Image
During this step, we use the *Dockerfile* provided along with our source code to construct a new docker image. A *Dockerfile* contains the instructions for building a docker image. The Dockerfile we are using to deploy the ecommerce application takes a base, Red Hat provided OpenJDK 1.8 image (Open JDK is the Java Development Kit - the runtime required to execute a Java application) and superimposes our executable JAR file on top of it to form a new Docker image, capable of running our application.

==== Push Image to Quay
In this stage we take the docker image that we just built and push it into Red Hat Quay - our centralized image registry.  Once the image is pushed to a registry, it can be made available to interested parties and promoted to different OpenShift or kubernetes based clusters. Quay has also been configured with Clair - which will perform a vulnerability scan of any images pushed to Quay. The Clair report will become available shortly after the image has been pushed into Quay.

==== OpenSCAP Scans
This will perform two OpenSCAP scans. A vulnerability scan and a Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guideline (STIG) compliance scan. Both reports will be collected by Jenkins and made available for viewing.

==== Deploy
This step will deploy the application into your Openshift user project, which will serve as a development environment. This environment is typically used by developers to verify applications come up as expected and also for performing automated integration tests.

==== OWASP ZAP Scan
During this stage a Jenkins Agent Pod will be started within OpenShift for the purposes of performing an OWASP ZAP baseline scan against the running container image.  The scan will analyze and crawl starting from the main page of our web application, searching for potential vulnerabilities lurking within javascript including things such as potential cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits. The resulting report will also be published by Jenkins.

==== Configure Stage Project
Configures the OpenShift staging project (i.e., userid-stage) so that the image can be promoted into it

==== Promote to Stage?
This step pauses the pipeline and waits for an authorized person (e.g., a QA test lead) to confirm promotion into a higher level environment.

==== Configure Prod Project
Configures the OpenShift production project (i.e., userid-prod)

==== Promote to Prod?
Similar to the previous _Promote to Stage?_ step, requiring manual intervention before promoting the application image to an even higher level environment.
